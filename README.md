# cpp_projects

cpp projects to improve my knowledge on the subject.

Will be adding more files/projects in the future.

a_start file is meant to be A* (A Star) algorithm.

Second branch(master) was added with the OSMP Project.

main branch was updated with a htop-like (Linux system monitor) project.
