Udacity CPP Capstone Project
This project was created as part of the Udacity C++ Developer Nanodegree. The idea came through some research and the
love for mathematics. You can find all the info that I based this project on Wikipedia.

Currently in this simulation, you start with 100 live cells (rectangles) and you can request a new (random) initial set
of live cells.

This project is organized into four classes: Controller, Game, Rectangle, Renderer.

    - Controller: This class is used to gather user input.
    - Game: This class is used to put all this together. It has two methods, Constructor and Run. Constructor has a loop
that allows the player to choose the simulation that he wants to start with. Run has an infinite loop that runs the
simulation until the player wants it to stop.
    - Rectangle: This class has the logic behind a single tile, that in this case, it's a SDL_Rect.
    - Renderer: This class contains all the game logic and all the logic and actions behind que render process of the
simulation. It has member functions to update the render, regarding all the game rules and other necessary member
functions for the game to run.

Dependencies for Running Locally
    - cmake >= 3.7
        All OSes: click here for installation instructions
    - make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
        Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
        Mac: install Xcode command line tools to get make
        Windows: Click here for installation instructions
    - SDL2 >= 2.0
        All installation instructions can be found here

    Note that for Linux, an apt or apt-get installation is preferred to building from source.

    - gcc/g++ >= 5.4
        Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
        Mac: same deal as make - install Xcode command line tools
        Windows: recommend using MinGW

Basic Build Instructions
    Clone this repo.
    Make a build directory in the top level directory: mkdir build && cd build
    Compile: cmake .. && make
    Run it: ./gameOfLife
